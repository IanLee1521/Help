USAJOBS is available to everyone! Setting up a USAJOBS account simply requires an email to sign up. Registered users can build a resume or upload a resume in a compatible format for submission across most Federal Agencies.

To search for potential job matches, seekers can look for positions through a variety of methods including agency, job type, location or salary range.
