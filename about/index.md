USAJOBS is available to everyone. Setting up a USAJOBS account simply requires an email to sign up. To date, USAJOBS has attracted over 17 million job seekers. Registered users can build a resume or upload a resume in a compatible format for submission across most federal agencies.

To search for potential job matches, seekers can look for positions through a variety of methods including agency, job type, location or salary range.

USAJOBS also allows agencies to meet their legal obligation (5 USC 3327 and 5 USC 3330) of providing public notice for federal employment opportunities.
