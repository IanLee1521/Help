  USAJOBS is designed to support the latest web browsers.
</h2>

We support the current and prior major releases of:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)
* [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/)
* [Microsoft Edge](http://www.browserfordoing.com/)
* [Internet Explorer 11](http://ie.microsoft.com/)

All of the designs meet the [WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and are compliant with [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](http://www.section508.gov/).

## Should I upgrade my browser?

If you can upgrade your browser, by all means you should do so. Older browsers can be:

* Slower.
* More likely to crash.
* Unable to display current web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3.
* More vulnerable to viruses, spyware, malware, and other security issues.

The latest and greatest browsers are more likely to be:

* More secure.
* Faster at loading pages.
* Less likely to crash.
* Able to automatically update to the latest version or notify you that an update is available.

### Help! I'm stuck on Internet Explorer 6/7/8/9

If you simply cannot upgrade your browser to the latest version you may be able to install [Google Chrome Frame](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromeframe?prefersystemlevel=true), which is a free plug-in, for older versions of Internet Explorer. While not currently supported Chrome Frame is more recent and will provide a more stable experience than those older versions of Internet Explorer.
