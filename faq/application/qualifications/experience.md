The amount of experience required varies for each job. Some jobs require no experience, while other jobs require years of specialized experience.

If you have questions related to how much experience you need for a particular job, review the **Job Requirements > Qualifications** section of the job announcement. For additional questions, [contact the hiring agency](../../../../how-to/application/agency/contact/) listed in the job opportunity announcement.
