“Status candidates” refers to those individuals who are current or former federal civilian employees who hold or held non-temporary appointments in the competitive service, not the excepted service. When a vacancy announcement indicates that status candidates are eligible to apply, Federal Government employees who have served at least 90 days after competitive appointment may apply.
