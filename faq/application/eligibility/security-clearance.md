No, not all Federal jobs require security clearance. However, all Federal positions require the candidate to undergo a suitability adjudication process to determine if the individual is suitable for Federal employment. This means that in addition to meeting the qualifications of a job announcement, an individual is determined likely or not likely to be able to carry out the duties of a Federal job with appropriate integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness.
