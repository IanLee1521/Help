## 1. Create a USAJOBS Account

Creating a USAJOBS account allows you to save jobs, save searches, upload or build new resumes, upload required documentation and submit an application for open job announcements. You can only apply to job announcements with an account and complete profile. By completing your profile, you will get a more streamlined and personalized experience.

## 2. Search for Jobs

Once you create your account, you can search for federal job announcements. The more criteria you add to your search, the more specific your search results will be. You can search for jobs using the basic, advanced or map search and when you find search results you like, you can save the search or specific jobs to your account.

When you sign into your account, we'll use your profile information to improve your search results.

## 3. Review Job Announcement

Once you find a job you’re interested in, review the announcement to determine if you’re eligible and meet the qualifications. We recommend reading the entire job announcement before beginning your application. If you have questions specific about the job, contact the agency representative listed at the bottom of the announcement.

## 4. Prepare your Application in USAJOBS

Read the “How to Apply” section of the job announcement before starting your application. When you’re ready to apply, we’ll walk you through a five-step process to prepare your application, including attaching a resume and required documents. During the USAJOBS application process, you can add new resumes or documents and review them for accuracy. We'll automatically save your progress as you prepare your application in USAJOBS.

## 5. Submit Application to Agency

Once your application is ready, you’ll be transferred from USAJOBS to the agency application system. You may need to complete other agency-required steps. Steps can include:

* Additional personal information
* Additional documentation
* Eligibility questions
* Occupational questionnaire

After you submit your application, return to your USAJOBS account to confirm the agency received your application. Agencies will confirm receipt of your application by updating your status to "Received." Status updates are available on your profile dashboard. You may also receive an email confirmation of your submission from the agency application system.

## 6. Agency Reviews Application

The hiring agency will review your application to make sure you're eligible and meet the qualifications for the position. The agency will review and place applicants into quality categories and may provide a status update of "Reviewed" (not all agencies provide this status). The agency will send applicants in the highest category to the hiring official. These applicants will receive a status of "Referred" on their profile dashboard. All other applicants (not being considered) will receive a "Not Referred" status.

## 7. Interview

The hiring official will review applications and select the applicants to interview based on agency policy. Hiring officials can choose to conduct panel, in-person, video or phone interviews. The agency will contact applicants directly to schedule interviews.

## 8. Selection

After interviewing applicants, the agency will select a candidate(s) and notify applicants who were not selected by updating their application status to "Not Selected." The agency will contact the candidate(s) to start the job offer process.

## 9. Job Offer

The hiring agency will extend a tentative job offer contingent upon passing a background investigation. Once the tentative offer is accepted, the background investigation will begin.  Additional security checks may be needed for a higher-level clearance. Once the background investigation and any additional security checks are successfully completed, the job offer is final and the agency will contact the candidate(s) directly to negotiate a start date.
