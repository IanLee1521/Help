The hiring agency determines whether a job seeker meets the minimum qualifications. As a result, you will need to contact the agency that posted the job opportunity announcement to inquire about the status of your application.

To locate the agency contact information, go to "My Account" and view the job summary in your application history. To contact the agency, click the "Agency Contact Info" link in the job announcement. You may also contact the human resources office of the hiring agency for additional assistance.
