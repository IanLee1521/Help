<strong>Partially true:</strong> In most agencies, the resumes are scanned by real people, Human Resource (HR) Specialists. However, NASA uses a contextual grammar based Artificial Intelligence software for an automated resume review. The automated review is more complex than a simple keyword search, it is based on a contextual resume content matching. The resume review is used as one step, in a multistep application review process. This process includes a review of all required areas of the applicantâ€™s eligibility and qualifications for the announcement. The resume review portion of the process includes both an automated and manual (by person) review of applicant packages.
