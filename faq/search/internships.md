Internships can be found in one of two ways:

1. Visit the [Pathways program page](https://www.usajobs.gov/StudentsAndGrads/) and click on **Find Internships**.
2. Navigate to our [Advanced Search](https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/AdvancedSearch/) and [search by type of work](../../../how-to/search/advanced/type-of-work/). One of the types of work is "Internships". You may also search for jobs open to "Recent Graduates".
