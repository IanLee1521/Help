Recent graduates and Presidential Management Fellows are generally eligible for:

* Retirement benefits
* Flexible spending accounts
* Health, life, dental, vision, and long-term care insurance

Interns hired on a short-term basis (e.g., summer hire) may not be eligible for the aforementioned benefits.

Pathways participants that will work at least 90-days accrue vacation and sick-leave once they begin their program.
