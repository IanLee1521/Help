To help narrow your Federal job search, below is a list of academic majors and some Federal occupations directly related to those majors. Occupations with an asterisk (*) require an academic degree or coursework in a particular area of study for entry into the occupation. For other occupations, experience or a combination of related coursework and experience may be substituted for a degree. The academic majors and occupations listed are not all-inclusive.

You may begin your Federal job search on USAJOBS by searching using the four-digit Series number of the Federal occupation listed under the major. When you find a Job Opportunity Announcement (a.k.a. job posting) that interests you, pay close attention to all sections of the announcement, especially: Who May Be Considered; Qualifications and Evaluations; and How to Apply so you will know the specific requirements you must meet.
