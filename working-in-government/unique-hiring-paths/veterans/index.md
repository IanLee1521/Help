The Federal Government has a long and outstanding record of employing veterans. Veterans have technical skills in areas of critical importance, and many already have security clearances required for some federal positions.

If you’re a Veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces and were separated under honorable conditions, you may be eligible for veterans' preference, as well as other veteran specific hiring options. 

## Veterans preference

With veterans’ preference, you may receive preference over non-veteran applicants in the hiring process. Veterans' preference can be used when applying to permanent and temporary positions in both the competitive and excepted service (of the executive branch). 

However, veterans' preference does not guarantee you a job and it doesn’t apply to the:
* Senior Executive Service
* Merit Promotion such as promotions, transfers, reassignments and reinstatements
* Executive branch positions for which Senate confirmation is required
* Positions within the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government, unless the position explicitly states it’s competitive service (for example a position in the Government Printing Office)

### Claiming Veteran's Preference
When claiming veterans’ preference, you must provide a copy of your DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, or other acceptable documentation. Applicants claiming 10-point preference will need to submit Form SF-15.
