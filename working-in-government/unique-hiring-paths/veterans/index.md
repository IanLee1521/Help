The federal government has a long and outstanding record of employing veterans. Veterans have technical skills in areas of critical importance, and many already have security clearances required for some federal positions.

If you are a Veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces and were separated under honorable conditions, you may be eligible for veterans' preference, as well as other special hiring paths for veterans.

## Veterans preference

Veterans’ preference gives eligible veterans preference in appointment over many other applicants. Veterans' preference applies to both the competitive and excepted service. However, Veterans' preference does not guarantee veterans a job and it does not apply to the Senior Executive Service or to internal agency actions such as promotions, transfers, reassignments and reinstatements.

When claiming preference, veterans must provide a copy of their DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, or other acceptable documentation. Applicants claiming 10 point preference will need to submit Form SF-15, Application for 10-point Veterans' Preference.
