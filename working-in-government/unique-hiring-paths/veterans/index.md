The Federal Government has a long and outstanding record of employing veterans. Veterans have technical skills in areas of critical importance, and many also already have security clearances required for some Federal positions. Federal service provides a means for veterans to continue their noble service to this country.

We recognize that Federal employment can sometimes seem complicated and overwhelming, particularly when you factor in things such as veterans’ preference and special hiring authorities for veterans.

The Office of Personnel Management in support of the President’s Veterans Employment Initiative, created a [one-stop web site resource for Federal veteran employment information](http://www.fedshirevets.gov/). The information on [fedshirevets.gov](http://www.fedshirevets.gov/) is designed to ensure veterans, transitioning service members, and their families receive accurate and consistent information regarding veteran’s employment in the Federal Government.
