Veterans who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces and were separated under honorable conditions may be eligible for veterans' preference. When claiming preference, veterans must provide a copy of their [DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty](/faq/application/documents/types/#dd-214), or other acceptable documentation.

Applicants claiming 10 point preference will need to submit Form SF-15, Application for 10-point Veterans' Preference. If you have questions about the applicability of veterans' preference for a particular vacancy please [contact the agency posting the announcement](../../../../how-to/application/agency/contact/).

Veterans' preference does not apply to positions in the Senior Executive Service or to internal agency actions such as a reassignment or promotion.
