The Federal Government is actively recruiting and hiring persons with disabilities. We offer a variety of exciting jobs, competitive salaries, excellent benefits, and opportunities for career advancement.

## Hiring Process

There are two types of hiring processes. In the _non-competitive_ hiring process, agencies use a special authority (Schedule A) to hire persons with disabilities without requiring them to compete for the job. In the _competitive process_, applicants compete with each other through a structured process. [Learn more about the hiring process](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/getting-a-job/#url=Hiring-Process).

### Schedule A Hiring Authority

Various authorities exist that permit exceptions from the normal competitive rules. These authorities are classified into several "schedules". One of the authorities in Schedule A relates to the appointment of individuals with intellectual disabilities, severe physical disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities (5 CFR 213.3102(u)).

### Veterans Appointments

There are a number of authorities available to assist veterans who are seeking, or wish to change, Federal employment including:

* Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA)
* 30% or More Disabled Veterans Program
* [Veterans Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA)](/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/veterans/veoa/)

### Selective Placement Program Coordinator (SPPC)

Most Federal agencies have a Selective Placement Program Coordinator (SPPC) or equivalent who helps management recruit, hire, and accommodate people with disabilities. SPPC's have many roles and responsibilities, including:

* Advising managers about candidates available for placement in jobs under special hiring authorities, as well as providing managers with information on reasonable accommodation and needs assessments for applicants and employees.
* Helping managers determine the essential duties of the position, identify architectural barriers and possible modifications that allow people with disabilities to perform essential duties.
* Helping people with disabilities get information about current job opportunities, types of jobs in the agency and how these jobs are filled and reasonable accommodations.
* Working with public and private organizations involved in the placement of applicants with disabilities to provide information about their agency program and job opportunities and to facilitate the placement of applicants with disabilities in their agency.
* Monitoring and evaluating selective placement program efforts and activities for people with disabilities to determine their effectiveness, and making changes as needed to improve program effectiveness.

A [SPPC directory is available from OPM](http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/selective-placement-program-coordinator-directory/).


## Reasonable Accommodations

Federal agencies are required by law to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified employees with disabilities. The Federal Government may provide you with a reasonable accommodation based on appropriate requests (unless so doing will result in undue hardship to the agencies).

Reasonable accommodations can apply to the duties of the job and/or where and how job tasks are performed. [Learn more about Reasonable accommodations](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/reasonable-accommodations/)
