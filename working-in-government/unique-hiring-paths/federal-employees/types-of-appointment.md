The Federal Government employs permanent and temporary employees.

## Permanent appointments

### Career-conditional appointment

Permanent employees are generally hired under a career-conditional appointment (Permanent - Career-Conditional Appointment). Normally this is the first career-type of appointment and the appointee must complete a 1-year probationary period and a total of 3 years continuous creditable service to attain a career appointment (Permanent - Career Appointment).

### Career appointment

A career appointment begins once an employee has completed 3 years of substantially continuous creditable service. The 3-year period generally begins and ends with non-temporary employment in the [competitive service](../../../service/).

### Non-temporary appointment

You may hear or read the term "non-temporary appointment". This is an appointment that does not have a specific "not-to-exceed" date associated with it. In other words, it is not a temporary appointment.

### Non-competitive assignment

You may hear or read the term "non-competitive" assignment or appointment. Under certain hiring authorities, which are established by law or Executive Order, a hiring manager may hire candidates directly without having to go through the full application process. Job announcements specify whether a position is competitive or non-competitive under the “Who May Apply” title.

## Temporary appointments

Temporary appointments are defined as appointments expected to last for a specified period not to exceed 1 year (Temporary Appointment - Time limited not to exceed 1 year but could be less) or a specified period of time that is at least more than 1-year but not to exceed 4 years (Term Appointment - Time limited more than one year but not more than 4 years).

Neither type of appointment is a permanent one, so they do **not** give the employee [competitive/permanent status](../../../service/).
