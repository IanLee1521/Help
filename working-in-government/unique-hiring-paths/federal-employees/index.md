As a federal employee itâ€™s important to understand which [service](../../service/) you belong to, the [type of appointment](appointments/) you have and whether or not you have competitive status. Understanding these three things will determine if you qualify for a merit promotion.

## Service, Appointment and Status Types

The Federal Government consists of three [types of services](../../service/):

1. Competitive Service
2. Excepted Service
3. Senior Executive Service

Within those services there are several [types of appointment](../../appointments/) including permanent and temporary appointments.

## Merit promotion for federal employees

If you are a current or former federal employee and hold a career appointment in the competitive service (also known as competitive status), you may be eligible for a merit promotion.

Merit promotion is the system under which federal agencies consider a current or former federal employee for an open position on the basis of personal merit.  The merit promotion program lets a current or former federal employee apply for a job without having to complete with the general public.  Instead, these individuals compete with other competitive status employees. Applicants are evaluated and ranked for the position based on their experience, education, competencies and performance.


### Types of merit promotion

There are several types of merit promotion for federal employees, including:

* [Transfer](../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/transfer/)
