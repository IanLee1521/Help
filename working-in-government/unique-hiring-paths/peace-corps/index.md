When you leave the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps VISTA, you have a certification of non-competitive eligibility for Federal jobs. This means that a Federal agency can hire you outside of a formal competitive announcement process for a vacant position.

Appointments must be made within 1 year after the Volunteer completes the qualifying service. The agency may extend the period for 2 more years to a total of 3 years if the individual, after the qualifying service, is in the military service; is studying at a recognized institution of higher learning; or has been involved in another activity which, in the agency's view, warrants an extension.

**Please note**: Agencies can only hire an eligible volunteer for positions an individual is qualified to perform. Thus, non-competitive eligibility does not necessarily entitle an individual to a position within the federal government. Instead, the individual must meet qualification standards and additional requirements, such as a background investigation. Be sure to note your service in the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps VISTA on your resume and attach your description of service to your application.
