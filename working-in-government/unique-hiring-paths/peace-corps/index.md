If you worked for the Peace Corp or AmeriCorp VISTA, you may be eligible to apply for and get hired for a competitive service job without going through the entire application process. This is also known as non-competitive eligibility.

## Eligibility

You’re eligible if you have at least one year of service with the Peace Corp or AmeriCorp VISTA.

Your eligibility lasts for one year after completing your Peace Corp or AmeriCorp service. Federal agencies may extend the period for up to three years if, after your completed service, you are:

* In the military service.
* Studying at a recognized institution of higher learning.
* Involved in another activity, which warrants an extension (at the agency’s discretion). 

Your eligibility does not entitle you to a job within the Federal Government. You must still apply and meet qualification standards and additional requirements, such as a background investigation. 

When applying for a job, include your Peace Corp or AmeriCorp VISTA certification of service documents with your application and make sure to mention your non-competitive eligibility status on your resume.
