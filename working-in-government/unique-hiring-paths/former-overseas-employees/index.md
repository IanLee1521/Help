If you are a family member (including same-sex domestic partners) of a federal civilian employee, or military member, who has completed 52 weeks of service in a federal position overseas, you may be eligible for jobs within the [competitive service](../../service/).

## Eligibility

Your eligibility lasts for three years following the date of your return to the United States from the overseas area.

With this eligibility, you can apply for competitive service positions without having prior competitive status and without having to compete with the public.

Your eligibility does not entitle you to a job within the federal government. You must still apply and meet qualification standards and additional requirements, such as a background investigation.
