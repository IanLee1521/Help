(Executive Order 13473) allows agencies to appoint a military spouse without competition. Agencies can choose to use this authority when filling competitive service positions on a temporary (not to exceed 1 year), term (more than 1 year but not more than 4 years), or permanent basis. The authority does not entitle spouses to an appointment over any other applicant.

As a military spouse you are eligible under this authority if your active duty military spouse:

1. Receives a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) move
2. Has a 100% disability rating OR
3. Died while on active duty.

Each of these categories has different eligibility criteria that must be met.
