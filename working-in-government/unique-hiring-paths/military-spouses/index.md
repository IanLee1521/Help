If you’re a military spouse, you may be eligible to apply for jobs open to merit promotion candidates or be hired for a [competitive service job](/../../service/) without going through the entire application process.

Supported by Executive Order 13473, federal agencies can use this hiring path to fill competitive service positions on either a [temporary or permanent](../../appointments/) basis.

## Eligibility

You’re eligible if your active duty military spouse:

* Receives a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) move.
* Has a 100% disability rating.
* Died while on active duty.

You must meet certain criteria for each of these eligibility categories. [Learn more about the specific criteria for military spouses](https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/shams/).

Your eligibility does not entitle you to a job within the Federal Government. You must still apply and meet qualification standards and additional requirements, such as a background investigation.
