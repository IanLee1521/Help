The Senior Executive Service (SES) is the corps of executives, selected for their leadership qualifications, and charged with leading the continuing transformation of government. These leaders possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad perspective of government and a public service commitment which is grounded in the Constitution. As the leaders of our Federal civilian workforce, Senior Executives strive each day to create a more citizen centered, result oriented Federal Government.

### Search for SES positions

Candidates can apply directly to a Federal agency for a specific SES position, or they may apply for an SES Candidate Development Program, which can lead to eligibility for a career appointment to an SES position without further competition. For more information, click Candidate Programs.

### Executive Core Qualifications

Applicants to SES positions must demonstrate they possess Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) when applying. The ECQs define the competencies needed to build a federal corporate culture that drives for results, serves customers, and builds successful teams and coalitions within and outside the organization. The ECQs are required for entry to the SES and are used by many departments and agencies in selection, performance management, and leadership development for executive positions.
