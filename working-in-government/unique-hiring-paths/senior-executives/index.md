The Senior Executive Service (SES) is a special hiring option for executive positions, including managerial, supervisory, and policy positions classified above General Schedule (GS) grade 15 or equivalent positions in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.

Candidates in these positions are selected for their leadership qualifications. They have exceptional managerial and people skills and know how to build partnerships and communicate with customers. They are committed to public service and share a broad perspective of government, which is grounded in the Constitution. 

## Eligibility

You may be eligible for a Senior Executive Service position if you meet the five Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs).

### Executive Core Qualifications

The ECQs help determine if you have the broad executive skills needed to succeed in a variety of SES positions. The ECQs are required for entry to the SES and are used by many departments and agencies in selection, performance management, and leadership development for executive positions. The five ECQs are:

1.  Leading Change
2.  Leading People
3.  Results Driven
4.  Business Acumen
5.  Building Coalitions

## Applying for Senior Executive Service positions

There are two ways you can apply for a senior executive service position:

1.  Apply directly to a federal agency for a specific SES position
2.  Apply for an SES Candidate Development Program (SESCDP)

This program helps identify and prepare aspiring senior executive leaders. Once you finish the program, you may be eligible for a career appointment to a senior executive service position without competing with the public.
