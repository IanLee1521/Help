    <h2 class="usajobs-uhp-section__title">Applying for Senior Executive Service positions</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="usajobs-uhp-section__col-right">
    <p>There are two ways you can apply for a senior executive service position:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Apply directly to a federal agency for a specific SES position</li>
      <li>Apply for an SES Candidate Development Program (SESCDP)</li>
    </ol>
