[Hiring authorities](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/hiring-authorities/) are a way for the Federal Government to hire individuals who may fall under one of the following groups of people, including:

* [Federal employees](federal-employees/)
* [Former overseas employees](former-overseas-employees/)
* [Individuals with disabilities](individuals-with-disabilities/)
* [Military spouses](military-spouses/)
* [Peace Corps & AmeriCorps VISTA alumni](peace-corps/)
* [Senior Executives](senior-executives/)
* [Students & recent graduates](students/)
* [Veterans](veterans/)

If you fall under one of these groups, you may be eligible to apply for certain jobs or receive preference through a hiring authority.  For example, if youâ€™re a veteran, you may be eligible for hiring authorities specific to veterans.

Hiring authorities are policies established by law or executive order, so there are exceptions to the rules.  [Get all the details for each hiring authority](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/hiring-authorities/) at [opm.gov](https://www.opm.gov/).
