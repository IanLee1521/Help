<strong>False</strong>: A federal resume requires more information than a civilian resume, therefore, it is typically longer than two pages. Some of the things that should be included are your educational and work experience. This includes job titles, salary, employment dates, duties and accomplishments, and how it relates to the knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) in the job announcement.
