<strong>False:</strong> You do NOT need to know someone to get a federal job. If you are qualified for a federal position, you can write a competitive federal resume. Make sure you add your knowledge, skills, and accomplishments (KSAs) into your resume and answer the questionnaire giving yourself all the credit that you can. You have to apply correctly following the directions. You CAN get "best qualified" and "referred to a supervisor" without knowing anyone in the government.
