The Federal Government consists of three types of services, the Competitive Service, the Excepted Service, and the Senior Executive Service.

### Competitive Service

Competitive Service positions are positions subject to the civil service laws passed by Congress to ensure that applicants and employees receive fair and equal treatment in the hiring process.

### Senior Executive Service

The Senior Executive Service (SES) is the corps of executives, selected for their leadership qualifications, and charged with leading the continuing transformation of government. These leaders possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad perspective of government and a public service commitment which is grounded in the Constitution. As the leaders of our Federal civilian workforce, Senior Executives strive each day to create a more citizen centered, result oriented Federal Government.

### Excepted Service

Excepted Service Positions are any federal or civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive service. Excepted service agencies set their own qualification requirements and are not subject to the appointment, pay, and classification rules in title 5, United States Code. However, they are subject to [veterans' preference](../unique-hiring-paths/veterans/preference/).

### Appointing authorities

Special non-competitive appointing authorities are established by law or Executive Order. Agencies may use a variety of appointing authorities to hire job applicants. Veterans, individuals with disabilities, many current and former Federal employees, and returning Peace Corps volunteers are examples of individuals eligible for non-competitive appointment.
