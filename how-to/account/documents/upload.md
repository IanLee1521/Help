Whether an agency accepts uploaded documents is specified in the How to Apply section in the job announcement. USAJOBS provides the ability to save up to ten additional documents along with your resumes. Such documents may include transcripts, a DD-214, SF-15, SF-50, OF-306, or other types of documents requested in job announcements.

## To Submit Uploaded Documents

1.  Log into USAJOBS My Account.
2.  Go to the Saved Documents section of your account.
3.  Enter a name for the document.
4.  Select Document Type from the drop down menu
5.  Select **Choose File**. Browse and select a file stored on your computer to be added to Saved Documents.
6.  Select **Open**
7.  Select **Upload File**. Your first uploaded file will appear as Document 1 (and the documents will appear in the order you upload them thereafter).
8.  Select View to download your uploaded document for review.  If you make changes to a document, the updated version of the file will need to be uploaded to your account.

### Please Note

On the Select Document step of the USAJOBS application process, you have the option to add documents as well.  Any document uploaded during the Select Document step will automatically be added to the Saved Documents section of your account.

**TIP**: Only attach the documents specifically requested by the announcement to which you are applying.
