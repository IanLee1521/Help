Some job announcements require certain documents or forms, such as transcripts, a DD-214, SF-15, SF-50, OF-306, or other types of documents. Read the **How to Apply** section in the job announcement to know which documents you need to provide.  

## To submit uploaded documents

1.  Sign into your USAJOBS account.
2.	Go to the **Documents** section of your account.
3.	Click **Other Documents**.
4.	Click the **Upload Documents** icon.
5.	Browse the documents stored on your computer, select the document you would like to upload, and click **Open**.
6.	Name your document-the default name will match the file title from your computer. You have the option to edit the name of the document.
7.	Select the **Document Type** from the options below the document name.  
8.	Click the **Complete Upload** button.
	
The uploaded document will appear in your account in the **Other Documents** section. The documents will appear in the order you upload them.

## Do all agencies accept uploaded documents?
Not all agencies accept uploaded documents from USAJOBS.  If the agency does not accept uploaded documents, you will skip this step during the USAJOBS application process.  You may be asked to upload a document when you enter the agency application system.

## Additional information

* Documents uploaded during the Select Documents step of the USAJOBS application process will automatically be added to the **Other Documents** section of your account.
* Only attach the documents specifically requested by the job announcement to which you are applying.
