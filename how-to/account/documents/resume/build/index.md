## Tips for formatting resumes in USAJOBS resume builder

You can copy and paste text from Word documents into the resume builder. However, some formatting in these documents may not work in the USAJOBS resume builder. To correct formatting errors inside your resume, you must first save the original file in a .txt format.

To copy and paste from Word:

1. Open up your Word document or other word processing tool.
2. Select the **File** tab at the top.
2. Go to the **Save As** option.
3. Choose to save it as a **Plain Text (*.txt)** file.
4. Open the new file and ensure the text appears in an acceptable format.
5. Copy and paste your resume text into the resume builder.

## Tips for submitting resumes to agencies

Some agencies accept uploaded resumes and resumes created using the USAJOBS resume builder, while some may only accept one or the other. Even though you may have both types of resumes associated with your account, the agency determines which ones to accept when you are applying online. The **Apply** button displayed on the job announcement page activates the process for a job seeker to complete an application.

USAJOBS automatically provides a list of available resumes/documents to attach to your application, and will only display resumes/documents the hiring agency is willing to accept. For example, if the hiring agency only accepts resumes created using the USAJOBS resume builder, then your uploaded resumes and documents will not be available to add to your application. Please pay special attention to the **How to Apply** section of the job announcement to find out which resume format and documents are accepted and how to submit them to the hiring agency.
