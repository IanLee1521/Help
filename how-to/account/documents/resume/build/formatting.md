You have the option of copying and pasting text from Word documents into the resume builder to more easily fill in the required information. However, some formatting in these documents may not work in the USAJOBS resume builder. To correct any formatting errors inside your announcement, you must first save the original file in a .txt format.

To do this, go to the **Save As** option in Word and then choose to save the document as a "Plain Text (*.txt)" file. Open the new file and ensure the text appears in an acceptable format and then copy and paste your resume text into the resume builder.
