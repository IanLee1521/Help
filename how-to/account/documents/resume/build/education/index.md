To receive consideration for some Federal positions you must provide information regarding your successful completion of a degree in a particular field from an accredited academic institution. In many cases, it is also important for you to provide information about specific coursework.

For example, if you are applying for a position with education requirements such as Engineer, Physicist, Accountant, Auditor or Contract/Procurement job, or if you wish to substitute education for experience to qualify for a job, you must include the required degree and coursework information in your resume. The vacancy announcement will specify these requirements.

When education is used to qualify for a position, Federal agencies will normally ask you to provide a transcript, either when you apply or upon tentative selection. By fully completing all of the blocks in this section, you help ensure that you receive appropriate credit for your academic credentials. If you have no degree, but have completed post-secondary courses, you should still provide that information.
