Making your resume searchable adds it to the USAJOBS Resume Mining collection.  Resume Mining allows HR specialists and hiring managers from federal agencies to search resumes of jobseekers who have USAJOBS accounts in order to seek applicants for their announcements

To make your resume searchable:

1. Navigate to your [Resumes](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/Resume/ListResumes/) in your account.
2. Select the "Make Searchable" link next to the resume of your choice.

### Important Details
- Only one of your resumes can be made searchable at a time.  
- If you wish to remove your resume from the Resume Mining collection select the 'Make Non-Searchable' link.
- Your resume will only remain searchable for 16 month unless it is renewed.
