## Built resumes

### Steps to edit your resume

2.  Go to the Resumes section of your account.
3.  Select the Edit link for the USAJOBS builder resume you would like to change.
4.  Once you have made your edits, select Save.
5.  Should you choose not to save your edits, select Cancel.

**Please note**: In the **Select Resume** step of the [USAJOBS Application Process](../../../../application/), you will also have the opportunity to edit your USAJOBS builder resume.

### Deleting a section
