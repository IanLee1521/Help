If you have a USAJOBS account, you can upload and manage your resume, required forms, and other documents.

1. Log into your USAJOBS account.
2. Click the **Documents** link located in the left-hand navigation.
3. Click **Resumes** or **Other Documents**

## Manage your resumes

You can upload and store up to five resumes in your account. Here is what you can do:

### Edit your resume

You can edit your resume using our Resume Builder or by uploading a new resume from your computer.[Learn how to edit your resume](resume/edit/).

### Delete a resume

You may need to delete a resume if you want to upload a new resume, but already have five in your account.  When you delete a resume, it will be completely removed from your account.

### Make a resume searchable

You can make your resume searchable, so your profile and resume will be visible to recruiters searching our resume bank. [Learn more about making a resume searchable](resume/searchable/).

### Upload a resume or create a resume

You can [upload a resume](resume/upload/) or [use our Resume Builder to build one](resume/build/). Resumes must be less than 3MB in size. You can upload in the following formats:

* GIF
* JPG
* JPEG
* PNG
* RTF
* PDF
* Word (.doc or .docx)

If you upload a resume, we recommend using Word, because you can make it searchable.
