To reset your USAJOBS password:

1. Go to the [Forgot Your Username or Password Page](https://www.usajobs.gov/Account/ForgotPassword)
2. Enter either the primary or secondary email address listed on your account. If you don’t have access to the email address listed on your account, fill out and submit the **Contact Us** form at the bottom of the page.
3. Click **Send Email**. If you haven’t accessed your account in over a year, you’ll be prompted to answer your secret questions.  If you can’t answer your secret questions, fill out and submit the **Contact Us** form at the bottom of the page.

You’ll receive a confirmation message on the screen that an email was sent to you. Please check your inbox or spam folder for one of two possible emails:

1. An email titled “USAJOBS Account - Password Reset” will contain a link to reset your password. You have 24 hours to use the link to create a new password. Once you click the link, enter your new password, verify the password and click **Submit**. You'll go to the “Sign in” page. Enter your email address and new password and click **Sign In**.
2. An email titled “USAJOBS Account Information” will inform you that the email address you entered does not match a registered account. At this time, you can try to reset your password using a different email address or you can create a new account.
