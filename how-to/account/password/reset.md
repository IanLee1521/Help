## Step by Step

To reset your USAJOBS password, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the [Forgot Password Page](https://www.usajobs.gov/Account/ForgotPassword)
2. Enter either the primary or secondary email address listed on your account and click the Send Email button.
3. You will receive a message on the page that an email was sent to you, and you will receive one of two possible emails.

   If you receive an email titled USAJOBS Account - Password Reset, it will contain a link to reset your password (this link is only active for 24 hours). Once you click the link, enter your new password and verify the password and click the Submit button. This will update your password, and you can now log into your account.

   If you receive an email titled USAJOBS Account Information, this email will inform you that the email address you entered does not match a registered account. At this time, you can try to reset your password using a different email address that you have access to, or you can create a new account.
