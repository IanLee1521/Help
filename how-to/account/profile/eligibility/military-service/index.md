## Derived Preference

Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference.

Both a mother and a spouse (including widow or widower) may be entitled to preference on the basis of the same veteran's service if they both meet the requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment.

## Veterans' Preference

Veterans who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces and were separated under honorable conditions may be eligible for veteransâ€™ preference.
