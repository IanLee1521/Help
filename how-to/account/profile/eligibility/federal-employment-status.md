Eligibility Question 4 focuses on current and former employees of the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches, independent agencies and employees under other merit systems. Individuals may have been employed on career, career-conditional, excepted service, term, temporary; time limited appointments, and non-status appointments. In addition, it does not apply to employees of federal contractors, unless an individual has been employed on a federal appointment.â€¨

Individuals, who previously held a career or career-conditional appointment with the federal government, may be eligible for reinstatement, which allows re-entry to the Federal competitive service workforce without competing with the public. Reinstatement eligibles can also apply for Federal jobs open only to status or merit promotion candidates. For more information, visit Reinstatement
