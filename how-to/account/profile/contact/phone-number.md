A valid phone number is a real working telephone number. This is normally what is meant when a website asks you to enter a valid phone number or if you are asked to give a valid phone number on a form. A valid phone number is a number that connects to a working telephone line.

## Formats

* **U.S. Phone Number**: XXX-XXX-XXXX
* **International Phone Number**: +X-XXX-XXX-XXXX - When phone numbers are published for use abroad they typically include the country calling code, but replace the international call prefix with "+" to signify that the caller should use the prefix appropriate for their country.
