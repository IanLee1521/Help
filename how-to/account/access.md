1. Complete the Contact Us form below.
2. In the **Question/Comment** box include the email address that is associated with your account (this is the email you can't access) and provide a new email address.
3. Click **Send**.

The USAJOBS help desk will send you an email asking for the answers to your security questions. You must reply to the help desk with your answers to regain access to your account. Once you reply to the help desk, they will update the email address in your account and send you another email, to your new email address, with a link to reset your password.

Click on the reset password link, change your password and you can get back into your USAJOBS account.
