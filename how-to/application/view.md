When you log in to your USAJOBS account, you’ll see a list of your job applications.  Any job application you create on USAJOBS.com is automatically saved to your account¬—this includes complete, incomplete and archived applications.

You’ll only see the 10 most recent applications (from newest to oldest), but you can choose to display more.

## What’s in the job application listing?

Each job application listing gives a quick summary of the position, your status, and if you need to complete or update the application. Here’s what you need to know:

### Job announcement information

This shows position title, hiring agency, job location(s), closing date, work schedule, series and grade and salary range.  [Learn more about the job announcement](../../job-announcement/).

### Application status

This tells you if your application is in progress, received, canceled, incomplete or unavailable. [Understand the different application statuses](../status/).

### Update or complete application buttons

Depending on the status of your job application, you may see a button to “Update” or “Complete application”.

You may need to [continue an application](../continue/), if it’s still in progress and you haven’t submitted it yet.

You may need to [update an application](../update/) if it was rejected as incomplete or if the job is still open and you want to add more information.

### Archive

You can archive a job application to save it for future use and get it out of your active list. Learn more about archiving an application
