3.	Review your list of applications.

The application status is highlighted next to each job application. Click the **+** to see more application details. You can also [filter your applications by status](#How to filter by status).

## What does each status mean?
Each status tells you where your application is within the application process—whether it’s been received, reviewed, selected, not-selected and more. 

### Advancing
The job application has been received by the hiring agency and is being considered for employment. 

**Received**

The hiring agency has received your job application.

**Reviewed**

The hiring agency has reviewed your job application, but has not yet determined if you're qualified.

#### Referred
Your application is among the best qualified and is referred to the next step in the selection process.

**Selected**

The hiring agency has offered you a position.

**Hired**

You have accepted the position.

### Paused
The job application has not been completed and requires further action. 

**In Progress**

The application has been started, but not completed or submitted yet. If the job is still open, you should complete the application and submit.

**Incomplete**

The application is not complete. . You may not have completed submitting your application in the application system or you may not have submitted the required documents, such as the DD-214. If the job is still open, you can update the application and submit.

### Stopped
Your application is no longer being considered for the job or the agency canceled the job. Applications with this status will automatically archive three months after the last status update.

**Canceled**

The job announcement has been withdrawn without anyone being hired. A job announcement can be canceled any time after the job is posted. 

**Not Referred**

Your application is not among the best qualified and has not been referred to the next step in the selection processes.

**Not Selected**

You have not been selected for the position.

**Not Hired**

You were not offered the position or you declined the offer.

### Unknown 
We can’t determine the status of the job application. 

**Unavailable**

There are a few reasons why an unavailable status may appear:

* We did not receive confirmation from the hiring agency that your resume was received, or that your application was complete. 
* You may not have completed the application process.
* You may not have properly logged out.
* The hiring agency’s system did not return your status to USAJOBS.

## Are there status delays for faxed documents?
Yes. If you [fax a resume or any other documents](../account/documents/fax/), there may be a delay between when the documents are faxed and when they appear as received on an application. If you have questions about the status of your faxed documents, [contact the hiring agency](/agency/contact/).

## How long can you keep your applications?
We will permanently remove all applications (active and archived) 36 months after the closing date, regardless of the application status. We recommend printing the announcements for which you have applied if you wish to keep a record of them beyond the 36-month period.

## How to filter applications  
You can filter your active and archived job applications by status—this is the status the hiring agency reports to USAJOBS. 

1.	Choose either your active or archived application list.
2.	Click **Filter by Application Status**.
3.	Select at least one of the status checkboxes. You can select more than one status at a time.
4.	Review your applications list – the applications will automatically filter based on your selection.

* The number next to each status tells you how many of your applications have that status.
* A brief description of each status appears if you place your cursor on top the status (For example, place your cursor on top of Received to reveal the description).

## Have questions about your status?
The hiring agency sends the status to USAJOBS. USAJOBS does not have any control over the status or lack of a status. If you think you’ve received an incorrect status or have questions about your status, please [contact the staffing point of contact on the job announcement](/agency/contact/).
