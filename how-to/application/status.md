Application Statuses in your USAJOBS account are a direct reflection of an Agency staff personnel input and action. USAJOBS does not have any control over the content or lack of a notification or application status. If you feel you have received an incorrect notification or should have received a notification but did not, please contact the staffing point of contact on the job vacancy announcement.

## Application Status Tips

The Application Status page documents your job application history. The following Application Status tips are helpful to keep in mind:

* Once you click on the Apply for this position now button, the job is automatically added to your application status list whether the application is completed or not.
* An application status remains on your list for 36 months and cannot be deleted prior to the 36-month period.
* After 36 months, the application status will drop off your list and you will not be able to see or retreive it.
* We recommend printing the announcements for which you have applied if you wish to keep a record of them beyond the 36-month period.
* For a more streamlined view of your application status list, you have the ability to Hide Applications. Click the Hide link to hide the application, and anytime you want to view them click on View Hidden Applications. To unhide applications so that they appear on your Application Status Page again, click the Unhide link.
