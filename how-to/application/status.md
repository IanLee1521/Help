The Application Status page documents your job application history.

**Please note**: Application statuses in your USAJOBS account are a direct reflection of an Agency staff personnel input and action. USAJOBS does not have any control over the content or lack of a notification or application status. If you feel you have received an incorrect notification or should have received a notification but did not, please [contact the staffing point of contact on the job announcement](/how-to/application/agency/contact/).

## Application Status Tips

* Once you click on the **Apply** button in the job annoucement, the job is automatically added to your application status list whether the application is completed or not.
* An application status remains on your list for 36 months and cannot be deleted prior to the 36-month period.
* After 36 months, the application status will drop off your list and you will not be able to see or retreive it.
* We recommend printing the announcements for which you have applied if you wish to keep a record of them beyond the 36-month period.
* For a more streamlined view of your application status list, you have the ability to hide Applications. Click the **Hide** link to hide the application, and anytime you want to view them click on **View Hidden Applications**. To unhide applications so that they appear on your Application status page again, click the **Unhide** link.
