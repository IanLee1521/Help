To view applications that you have hidden:

1. Log into your USAJOBS account.
2. Go to Application Status in your USAJOBS account.
3. Select the 'View Hidden Applications' link (slightly centered just above the application status list). You will be taken to a list of applications that you have hidden.
4. To unhide, select on the 'Unhide' link to the left of the jobs title in blue (far left column).
