To create an application on USAJOBS:

1. Log into your USAJOBS My Account.
2. Ensure all five sections of your USAJOBS Profile are updated as some of the Profile information is carried over to the agency application system when you begin the application process. Your Profile includes the following sections: Contact Information, Hiring Eligibility, Other, Demographic, and Account Information.
3. Locate the job announcement for which you would like to apply. You can use Basic, Advanced, Map, or your Saved Searches to find job announcements.
4. Thoroughly review the job announcement, including the **How to Apply** and **Required Documents** sections. When you are ready to begin the application, select **Apply Online**.
5. The process will take you through five steps: (1) Select Resume, (2) Select Documents, (3) Review Package, (4) Include Personal Info, and (5) Continue Application with Agency.
6.  The final step of the five step process will take you to a page that asks you to certify your application is true, complete, and made in good faith. If the answer is yes, check the box and select **Continue to Agency Site**. If you would like to go back to your application to review or edit your information, please select **Previous**.

**Please note**: Once you select **Continue to Agency Site** you will be redirected to an agency application system where additional steps may be required.
