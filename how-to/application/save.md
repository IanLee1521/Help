Your application will automatically save as you continue through the USAJOBS application process.  Once you select the **Save & Continue** button your entries are saved for that step in the process. You can access saved applications on your Application Status page in your account. Saved applications are labeled with an “In Progress” status.

**Please note**:  Once you progress into the agency application system, your progress may not be automatically saved.
