1.  Log into your USAJOBS My Account.
2.  Go to the Application Status section of your account.
3.  Locate the application you would like to update and review the Job State. If the Job State is “Open,” you can update your application.
4.  Select the **Update Application** link.
5.  You will be brought to the Review step of the USAJOBS application process.
6.  If you would like to change or update your resume, select the **Add/Remove Resume** link.  If you would like to change your documents, select the **Add/Remove Documents** link.
7.  Once you have changed your resume or documents, complete the remaining steps in the USAJOBS application process.
8.  On the final step of the USAJOBS application process select **Continue to Agency Site**. Once you are redirected to the specific agency application system you will need to complete the remaining steps of your application.  Your application will not be updated until you select **Submit** in the agency application system.

## Notes

* Job announcements with an “Open” job state are still accepting applications and updated applications.
* Job announcements with a “Closed” job state are no longer accepting applications or updates to previously submitted applications.
* Editing your resume and/or documents in your USAJOBS account will not affect your application unless you resubmit the application with the new changes (this also applies to editing Profile information). Also, the application may display both old and new resumes/documents; however, the agency will review your most recent submission by acknowledging the date and time stamp next to the attachment(s).
* Agencies have certain legal requirements for records retention; however, you may request that the agency remove you from consideration or accept changes/additions to your application by contacting the agency representative listed on the job announcement.
