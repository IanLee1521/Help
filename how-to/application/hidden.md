2. Go to Application Status in your USAJOBS account.
3. Click on the View Hidden Applications link (slightly centered just above the application status list). You will be taken to a list of applications that you have hidden.
4. To unhide, click on the Unhide link to the left of the jobs title in blue (far left column).
