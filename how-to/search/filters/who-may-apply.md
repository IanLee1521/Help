The "Who May Apply" search filter will allow you to filter search results in two ways:

1. **U.S. Citizen** - Selecting this option shows jobs open to all of the U.S. public. This is the default option.

2. **Federal employees**  - Selecting this option shows jobs open to all of the U.S. public AND jobs that are only open to eligible federal employees. Selecting this option may display jobs for which you <strong>may not be eligible</strong>. Please refer to our eligibility FAQ to determine [which jobs you are eligibile to apply for](../../../../faq/application/eligibility/).
