The "Who May Apply" search filter defaults to the "U.S. Citizen" option which shows jobs open to all of the U.S. public.

The "Federal employees" option show those jobs AND jobs that are only open to eligible federal employees. Selecting the "Federal employees" will display jobs for which you <strong>may not be eligible</strong>.
