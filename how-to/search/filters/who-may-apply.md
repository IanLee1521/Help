Some federal jobs are open to the general public &mdash; meaning any U.S. citizen can apply. But, some federal jobs are only open to eligible federal employees. You can filter your job search results to only show jobs that you may be eligible for.

### U.S. Citizen

Select this option if you are a U.S. Citizen and have never worked for the federal government.

You will only see jobs open to the public. You will not see jobs that are **only open** to eligible federal employees.

Most federal jobs require you to be a [U.S. citizen](../../../../working-in-government/us-citizens/), but there are some exceptions for [non-U.S. citizens](../../../../working-in-government/non-citizens/).

### Federal employees

Select this option if you are:

#### A current or former federal civilian employee

* Who holds or held a [non-temporary appointment](../../../../working-in-government/appointments/).
* In the [competitive service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) in the Executive branch or in a position not in the Executive branch specifically included in the competitive service by statute.
* In an [excepted service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) position covered by an [interchange agreement](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/interchange-agreements/).
* Eligible for [reinstatement](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/reinstatement/).

#### A Veteran

* Eligible for [veterans' preference](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/veterans/preference/) or separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after three years ,or more, of continuous military service.

If you select this option, youâ€™ll see jobs open to the general public AND jobs that are only open to eligible federal employees (you may also see jobs that you are not eligible for). Learn more about [which jobs you are eligible to apply for](../../../../faq/application/eligibility/).
