The "Who May Apply" search filter defaults to the "U.S. Citizen" option which shows jobs open to all of the U.S. public. The "Federal employees" option show those jobs AND jobs that are only open to eligible federal employees. Selecting the "Federal employees" will display jobs for which you <strong>may not be eligible</strong>.

### Who is eligible?

Federal employees who have worked for a federal agency for 3 years or more are allowed to apply for federal opportunities open to status candidates.

Status applicants refers to those individuals who are current or former Federal civilian employees who hold or held non-temporary appointments in the competitive service, not the excepted service. Individuals with status are eligible for noncompetitive movement within the competitive service because they are now or previously were serving under career-type appointments in the competitive service.

Status applicants may be eligible for the following under merit promotion procedures:

* Restoration Rights
* CTAP/ICTAP
* Transfer
* Reinstatement
* Interchange Agreements

NOTE: Certain veterans eligible under the [Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA)](https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/shav/index.aspx/) may also apply and be considered under vacancy announcements limited to status candidates.
