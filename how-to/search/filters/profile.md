The **Profile - Eligibility** search filter appears once you are logged in and have completed the [Eligibility](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/Profile/HiringEligibilityData/) section of your profile. Once that section is complete filters will appear here based on your answers to those eligibility questions.

### Federal employees

#### I am currently a federal civilian employee.

If you have selected this option under question 4 in your Profile under Eligibility you will be able to filter your search results in two ways:

1. **Publicly available** - Selecting this checkbox will show jobs that are open to all of the U.S. public.
2. **Federal employees** - Selecting this checkbox will show jobs that are open only to eligible federal employees. Selecting this option may display jobs for which you <strong>may not be eligible</strong>. Please refer to our eligibility FAQ to determine [which jobs you are eligible to apply for](../../../../faq/application/eligibility/).

NOTE: Selecting both checkboxes will show both sets of jobs.

#### I am a former federal civilian employee with reinstatement eligibility.

If you have selected this option under question 4 in your Profile under Eligibility you will be able to filter your search results in two ways:

1. **Publicly available** - Selecting this checkbox will show jobs that are open to all of the U.S. public.
2. **Reinstatement eligible** - Selecting this checkbox will show jobs that are open only to federal employees with [reinstatement eligibility](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/reinstatement/).

NOTE: Selecting both checkboxes will show both sets of jobs.

### Veterans

#### Are you a veteran who was separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after completing an initial continuous tour of duty of at least 3 years (may have been released just short of 3 years) (VEOA)?

If you have answered **Yes** to this question under question 3 in your Profile under Eligibility you will be able to filter your search results in two ways:

1. **Publicly available** - Selecting this checkbox will show jobs that are open to all of the U.S. public.
2. **VEOA eligible** - Selecting this checkbox will show jobs that are open only to Veterans with [VEOA eligibility](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/veterans/veoa/). This provides access to jobs that are otherwise open only to eligible federal employees.

NOTE: Selecting both checkboxes will show both sets of jobs.

## No profile or incomplete profile

By default the jobs shown to those without a complete [Eligibility](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/Profile/HiringEligibilityData/) section of their profile are jobs that are open to all of the U.S. public.
