You can use the location filter to limit your search results to one location. You can only select one location filter in the basic search. To select multiple locations, use [advanced search](../../advanced/location/).

To filter by location:

1. Click **Location** located under the **Refine your results by** section, on the left side of the search results page.
2. Click **Add Location to Search**.
2. Enter a city, state, zip code or country in the location text box or choose a location from the State/Territory/Region and Locale list.
3. Click **Update Search** to add the location to your search results.

Remember, if you want to add more than one location, use [advanced search](../../advanced/location/).
