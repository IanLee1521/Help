The search results page displays all jobs that match the information you provide in a search.   You can narrow your results using the filters on the left side of the page and save your results using the buttons below the filters.  We've highlighted the most commonly used sections of the search results page.

## Job results and descriptions

All relevant jobs and their descriptions will display in the center of the search results page. The job description is a condensed version of the job announcement and includes:

* **Position Name**: the name the federal government uses to identify the position– this may be different from the name of the same position in the private sector. To open the complete job announcement click on the position name.

* **Salary**:  The [salary from the GS pay schedule](../../../faq/pay/series-and-grade/), starting with the lowest grade at the step 1 level listed in the job announcement to the highest grade at the step 10 level.

* **Series & Grade**: The federal [series and grade](../../../faq/pay/series-and-grade/).

* **Location(s)**: The work location. Many jobs have multiple locations, so the job announcement may list more than one location.

* **Open Period**: Most job announcements [expire on a certain date](../../../faq/job-announcement/expiration/).

* **Announcement Number**: This is a unique number assigned to the job announcement.

* **Department**: The highest level of the agency. For example, the Department of Defense. Not all job announcements will list a department.

* **Agency**: The organizational level under the department.

* **Position Info**: The [work schedule](../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/) of the position for example, full-time, part-time, temporary, or term.

* **Who May Apply**: A short description of who is [eligibile to apply for this position](../../../faq/application/eligibility).
