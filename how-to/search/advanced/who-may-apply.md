Some federal jobs are open to the general public—meaning any U.S. citizen can apply. But, some federal jobs are only open eligible federal employees.  You can refine your job search results to only show jobs that you may be eligible for.

#### No – I do not fall into one of these categories and only want to see jobs open to the public

Select this option if:

* You are a [U.S. citizen](../../../../working-in-government/us-citizens/) and have never worked for the federal government.
* Do not fall into one of the eligibility criteria listed below.

#### Yes – I fall into one of these categories and want to see all jobs open to applicants with the above eligibilities, such as federal employees.

Select this option if you are:

#### A current or former federal civilian employee

* Who holds or held a [non-temporary appointment](../../../../working-in-government/appointments/).
* In the [competitive service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) in the Executive branch or in a position not in the Executive branch specifically included in the competitive service by statute.
* In an [excepted service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) position covered by an [interchange agreement](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/interchange-agreements/).
* Eligible for [reinstatement](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/reinstatement/).

#### A Veteran

* Eligible for [veterans' preference](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/veterans/preference/) or separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after three years ,or more, of continuous military service.

If you select this option you will see jobs open to the general public AND jobs open to eligible federal employees. You may see jobs you aren’t eligible for.
