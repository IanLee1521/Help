Department and Agency makes your search easier in two different ways:

1. An autocomplete text box which helps identify words you are typing and allows you to select the word
2. The Department/Agency wizard if the user selects to search via an alternative method.

Once you start typing the text that matches (anywhere in the word not just beginning) will display in the box with the matching characters in bold.

Once you make a selection that department or agency is added to the **You Added Box**. When the user clicks on a selection, the selection will be added to the **You Have Added** box.

**Please note**: Once you have selected 10 rows, you must remove a selection before another selection can be made.
