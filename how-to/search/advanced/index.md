You are able to refine your search by:

* [Department and Agency](department-and-agency)
* [Occupational Pay Series or Job Category](occupational-series/)
* [Location](location/)
* [Posting date](posting-date/)
* [Salary or Pay Grade](salary/)
* [Type of Work](/working-in-government/pay-and-leave/types-of-work/)
* [Who may apply](who-may-apply/)
* [Work schedule](/working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/)

## Advanced keyword Search Tips

The keyword search options in advanced Search allows you to tailor search results by all words, exact phrase, or one or more words. In addition, Advanced Search permits the exclusion of unwanted words.

**All of these words** - The search will produce all records that contain every word in this search field regardless of the order in which they appear in the record. For example, a search on Management and Program Analyst will yield instances of Management and Program Analyst as well as management and program analysis. Weâ€™re not using synonyms here so it would find any references of Management and Program both appearing in the JOA but not necessarily side by side.

**The exact phrase** - The search will return results where the exact words entered appear together in a Job Opportunity Announcement. Synonyms are not used with this option. For example, a search on Management and Program Analyst will only yield instances of Management and Program Analyst and not Program Analyst. In this field, search terms with three or fewer characters may be used.

**Any of these words** - The search will return results where one or more of the words appear in the Job Opportunity Announcement. For example, a search on HR Specialist will yield instances with HR, Specialist, or both.

**Words similar to** - The search will return results with words that are similar to some or all of these words. For example, a search on Super will yield instances of Supervisor.

**But none of these words** - The search results must not include any of the words entered.

In Advanced Search, the top of the results page displays a translation of the search criteria into the relevant inclusion, exclusion, or other operators. This detailed display may help users edit their searches more quickly or apply operators to Basic Search.
