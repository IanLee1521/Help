#### Salary Range

The minimum and maximum amount of pay within a pay grade or pay band for that position. Agencies offers pay for a position depending on their pay setting rules and your qualifications. Each online job announcement notes the specific education and/or experience requirements that are reviewed to create a salary range for that position.

#### Pay Grade/General Schedule

Announcements are also classified by the Federal Government's General Schedule (GS) pay scale. As a result, announcements usually provide the salary as well as their GS equivalents.

#### Show Only Senior Executive Postings

Select this option to search for all Senior Executive Service opportunities that meet the search criteria.

## Guidance

For example, to search for positions that fall within the GS-9 and GS-12 levels, select 9 (as the low) and 12 (as the high) values.

To refine your search results by Pay Grade, select a grade level provided in the refine pop-up box.
