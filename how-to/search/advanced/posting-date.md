There are two options in [advanced search](/how-to/search/advanced/) under [Posting Date](https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/AdvancedSearch/#idAdditionalOptions) that allow for searching by the date that a job announcement was posted.

#### Exclude posting for jobs open longer than 30 days?

Selecting **Yes** will exclude job announcements that are open for longer than 30 days. This will exclude many open, continuous, and standing register jobs that may be open for long periods of time.

#### Show Jobs Posted

This option allows for searching for jobs that were posted today, yesterday, or within several different periods of time (3, 5, 7, 10, 30, and 60 days). This will filter your results by the day the job announcement was posted.
