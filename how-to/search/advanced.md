Advanced Search provides users more search refinement options. This tool also allows you to search for specific words and phrases, or words that are similar.

You are able to refine your search by:

* Salary or Pay Grade
* Occupational Pay Series or Job Category
* Location
* Department and Agency
* Type of Work or Work Schedule
* Additional Search Options

The **Who May Apply** refiner has additional resources that will help you identify whether or not you are eligible to apply for a specific job.

## Advanced Search Tips

Advanced Search allows you to tailor search results by all words, exact phrase, or one or more words. In addition, Advanced Search permits the exclusion of unwanted words.

**All of these words** - The search will produce all records that contain every word in this search field regardless of the order in which they appear in the record. For example, a search on Management and Program Analyst will yield instances of Management and Program Analyst as well as management and program analysis. Weâ€™re not using synonyms here so it would find any references of Management and Program both appearing in the JOA but not necessarily side by side.

**The exact phrase** - The search will return results where the exact words entered appear together in a Job Opportunity Announcement. Synonyms are not used with this option. For example, a search on Management and Program Analyst will only yield instances of Management and Program Analyst and not Program Analyst. In this field, search terms with three or fewer characters may be used.

**Any of these words** - The search will return results where one or more of the words appear in the Job Opportunity Announcement. For example, a search on HR Specialist will yield instances with HR, Specialist, or both.

**Words similar to** - The search will return results with words that are similar to some or all of these words. For example, a search on Super will yield instances of Supervisor.

**But none of these words** - The search results must not include any of the words entered.

In Advanced Search, the top of the results page displays a translation of the search criteria into the relevant inclusion, exclusion, or other operators. This detailed display may help users edit their searches more quickly or apply operators to Basic Search.

## Keyword Search Tips

When searching by keywords, please keep the following in mind:

The keyword function searches for all terms in one job. If you list multiple words you will only see Job Opportunity Announcements which include all of the words you selected. You will not see any Job Opportunity Announcements that only have one or two of the words you selected. To maximize the number of jobs returned during your search, try limiting your search to only one keyword.

Use quotations to show job postings with the keywords you have listed as a whole. For example, if you search for physical fitness, you will see results for both words side-by-side and placed individually in the Job Opportunity Announcement. However, if you search for "physical fitness", it will only show results for Job Opportunity Announcements that include the words physical fitness side-by-side.

To ensure that you get the most relevant results, we will automatically return results using synonym equivalents of your keywords. For example, if you entered Program Manager we will automatically look for jobs containing Program Coordinator and Program Director.
