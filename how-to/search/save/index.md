You can save a search to help you look for jobs in your area of interest. When you save a search, USAJOBS will automatically look for jobs that match the keywords and other criteria in your search. We will email you, daily, weekly or monthly, when there are new jobs that match what you’re looking for.

You can create and save up to 10 saved searches. For example, you can save a search looking for all Program Analyst jobs in Washington D.C. and another search for all Program Analysts jobs at the Department of Energy.

The saved search will expire one year after you create it.

### To save a search:

1.	Log into your USAJOBS account. If you don’t have an account, you need to create one. Only signed in users can save their search.
2.	Start a job search by entering a keyword or location and click **Search**. You can also choose the **Advanced Search** option to narrow your results.
3.	Click **Save current Search** on the search results page located on the left side of the page under the [search filters](../filters/).
4.	Confirm how you want to search for keywords (similar to, exact match etc.).
5.	Enter additional search criteria if you want—the more information you add, the more specific your results will be.
6.	Name your search—this will help you manage your saved searches.
7.	Choose how often you want to receive an email notification with all jobs that match your search.
8.	Click **Save current Search** or **Save and View Results**.
