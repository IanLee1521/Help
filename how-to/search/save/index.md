Saved Searches help you look for Job Opportunity Announcements in your area of interest. The saved searches will automatically search for jobs based on your selected criteria, and then email you when there are new jobs entered into the database that meet your specifications (they will not email you jobs that were previously posted).

You may create and save up to 10 Saved Searches. The USAJOBS saved search creation, editing, deletion, and viewing functions are all located within your [USAJOBS account](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/SavedSearches/ListSavedSearches/).
