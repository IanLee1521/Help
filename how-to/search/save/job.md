If you have a job saved in your account and it is no longer there, the agency may have removed the posting, therefore the job will not be on your saved jobs list anymore. A job will also be removed from your saved jobs list once you apply, and you can now view the job from the Application Status page.

The Agency controls a job postingâ€™s start and close date, determining when and how long the posting remains visible and/or active. The closing time for jobs is 11:59PM Eastern Time; however, an agency may choose to expire a job before its closing date. An expired job will also be removed from search results.
