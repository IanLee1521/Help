To stop receiving saved search email notifications:

1. Sign into your USAJOBS account.
2. Go to your **Saved Searches**.
3. Click the **+** next to a saved search to see more details.
4. Click the filled-in **star icon**, with the label “Saved”. The star will no longer be filled and the label will change to “Save”. 
5. Refresh the page, or go to a new page—the search will be removed from your account and you will no longer receive email notifications with those search results.

## Additional information
Saved searches expire after one year and will automatically move into your archived list and you will not receive emails.
