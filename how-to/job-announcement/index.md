Agencies post job announcements on USAJOBS to advertise their current job openings.  While these announcements can be lengthy, they include valuable information about the job responsibilities and requirements.  We’ve highlighted some of the critical details you need to know, but it’s important you read the entire job announcement before applying.

## Read the top of the job announcement

The details at the top of the announcement can tell you whether you’re eligible to apply, if the job is in a location you like and how long you have to apply. Key fields to review:

**Who May Apply** - This section tells you who is eligible to apply to the announcement.  Make sure you’re eligible before applying.

**Closing Date** - The closing date is the last day you can submit an application for the job—you can’t submit an application after 11:59pm EST on that date.

**Locations** - This section lists the work location(s).  Many jobs have multiple locations, so it’s important you verify the location is somewhere you want to work.

## Read about the job duties

The Duties section describes the job’s daily activities and responsibilities.

## Read about the job key requirements

Key Requirements can range from type of citizenship to uniform details.

## Read the job qualifications

The Qualifications section describes the experience, skills and other job related criteria. To be considered for the job, you must meet the qualifications. It’s important you read the entire section, because some job announcements include many qualifications.

## Read the How to Apply instructions

It's very important you read the How to Apply instructions, located in the drop down on the right side of the job announcement.  The How to Apply instructions outline the upcoming application steps and the multiple ways to apply for the job announcement. Underneath the How to Apply section are details on how the agency will evaluate your application.  A link to a preview of the assessment questions is available at the bottom of the How You Will Be Evaluated section.  If you plan on applying to the job announcement, review the vacancy questions before starting your application.

## Read the Required Documents section

It’s very important you read the Required Documents section, located in the drop down on the right side of the job announcement.  This section lists all the documents you may need to include with your application to prove you’re eligible and qualified. Please note that not all documents listed may be required dependent on your eligibility and qualifications.  If you don’t submit the required documentation, you may get disqualified.

## Start Your Application

Once you read the entire announcement and are ready to apply, select the **Apply** button to begin the application process.  If you’re not ready to apply, select the **Save** link to add the job announcement to the Saved Jobs section of your Profile.

## Important Details:
