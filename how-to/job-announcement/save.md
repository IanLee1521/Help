If you have a USAJOBS account, you can save up to 10 job announcements. Click the **Save Job** link in the search results -- any saved jobs will display in the **Saved Jobs** listing of your account.

## Manage your saved jobs in your account

When you log into your USAJOBS account, you’ll see **Saved Jobs**.  The Saved Jobs displays each job announcement you save on USAJOBS. Here’s what you can do:

### Sort your saved jobs
By default, the most recent saved jobs are listed at the top, but you can sort by:

* Saved date
* Agency
* Closing date
* Job title

### Receive email notifications
You can receive an email any time a saved job is scheduled to close in three calendar days. To receive email notifications, click on the **Notifications** icon and select the checkbox. 

### View job announcement information
Click the **+** to see more details about the saved job. Each saved job shows a summary including:

* Position title
* Hiring agency
* Job location(s)
* Closing date
* The date you saved the job
* Work schedule
* Series and grade
* Salary range
