### Apply, view more or delete saved jobs
Within the saved jobs details you can also apply, delete or view more similar jobs.

### What if I don't see a saved job in my account?
There are a few reasons why you may not see a saved job in your account:

* The agency may have closed the job announcement-an agency may choose to close a job before its [posted closing date](../../job announcement/how to understand the job announcement/).
* The agency may have canceled the job announcement.
* You may have applied to the job. When you apply to a saved job it moves into your Active Applications.
