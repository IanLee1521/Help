You can save up to 10 job announcements in your USAJOBS account.

To save a job:
  1.  Sign into your USAJOBS account.
  2.  Search for a job by typing a keyword or location into the search box.
  3.  Review the job search results.
  4.  Click the **Save Job** link next to the job title for each job you want to save.
  5.  Review your saved jobs in the **Saved Jobs** section of your account.

### What if I do't see a saved job in my account?

There are a few reasons why you may not see a saved job in your account:
* The agency may have closed the job announcement-an agency may choose to close a job before it's [posted closing date](../../job announcement/how to understand the job announcement/)
* The agency may have canceled the job announcement.
* You may have applied to the job. When you apply to a saved job it moves into your Active Applications.
